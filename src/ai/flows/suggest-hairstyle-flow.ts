// This file is DELETED as its functionality is replaced by 
// diagnose-face-suggest-hairstyle-flow.ts and generate-hairstyle-tryon-flow.ts
// An empty file or removal is appropriate. For the XML operation, 
// we'll provide empty content to signify deletion if the system handles it,
// or this change block can be omitted if file deletion isn't directly supported.
// For now, let's assume providing empty content effectively removes its old logic.
// The actual file deletion should be handled by the user or build process if necessary.
